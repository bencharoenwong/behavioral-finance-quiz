Michael should consider whether he's a risk-taker or risk-avoider overall, and apply that approach consistently to both gains and losses.",
          "feedbackIncorrect": "Research in behavioral finance has identified a common pattern called loss aversion, where many investors prefer certainty when gaining but take risks to avoid losses. This natural tendency often leads to portfolio behaviors like selling winners too early while holding losing investments too long, which can impact long-term returns."

The optimal approach would research both funds' current valuations and future prospects while giving minimal weight to past regrets or missed opportunities. Past performance doesn't predict future returns, and different market environments favor different types of investments. Your current investment should be based on thorough analysis of present market conditions, valuations, and your financial goals—not attempts to avoid feelings of regret about previous decisions.",

Good investors consistently apply the same evaluation standards to all holdings regardless of how they were acquired.",

Financial advisors typically recommend periodically reviewing all holdings using the same objective criteria, regardless of their source."

When a stock drops significantly, they investigate both bull and bear arguments with equal attention, ensuring decisions are based on comprehensive analysis rather than selective information.",
          "feedbackIncorrect": "Seeking primarily positive information after an investment declines reflects a common cognitive pattern that behavioral researchers call confirmation bias. Studies show that many investors naturally search for information that supports their existing views while paying less attention to contradictory evidence.

Effective investors develop the habit of examining both positive and negative frames when evaluating opportunities.

This balanced perspective often leads to more consistent decisions based on substance rather than presentation style.",

Research shows that many investors respond differently to the same information depending on whether it's presented positively (success rates) or negatively (failure rates).

          "feedbackCorrect": "Alex is maintaining investment discipline by avoiding the temptation to spend market gains. Consistent long-term investing, regardless of market conditions, typically yields better results than taking money out during upswings. This approach acknowledges that market timing is difficult and emotional decisions often reduce returns.",
          "feedbackIncorrect": "Withdrawing investment gains for personal purchases during market highs is a common tendency that financial researchers identify as a self-control challenge. Studies show that many investors naturally feel that market gains represent 'free money' that can be spent. However, investment performance data demonstrates that maintaining the compounding effect through market cycles often leads to significantly better long-term results. Professional investors typically establish withdrawal rules that operate independently of market conditions."

Modern portfolio theory emphasizes including assets with different correlation patterns - such as high-quality bonds, commodities, or alternative investments - alongside various equity categories. This approach typically provides more protection during market downturns than diversification across equity categories alone."

This balanced view acknowledges the statistical challenges of consistently beating the market.",
          "feedbackIncorrect": "The belief that careful research consistently outperforms random selection reflects a perspective that many investors share. However, a substantial body of academic research has found surprising results: randomly selected diversified portfolios frequently outperform carefully researched selections. This occurs partly because random selection automatically creates broader diversification and eliminates the influence of behavioral factors. Many institutional investors have incorporated these findings by combining passive diversification with targeted active strategies."

This can be done either through immediate rebalancing or through a structured implementation plan with regular reassessment.

Professional investors establish systematic review processes and predetermined criteria for when to adjust their portfolios.",
          "feedbackIncorrect": "Maintaining current allocations despite new analysis suggesting beneficial changes illustrates a pattern that behavioral economists call status quo bias. Research shows this is a very common tendency - most investors naturally prefer their existing portfolios and require significantly more evidence to make changes than to maintain current positions. Awareness of this tendency has led many financial advisors to establish systematic review processes with predetermined adjustment criteria to help overcome this natural preference for the familiar."
